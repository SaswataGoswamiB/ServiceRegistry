Here we are creating a User Entity.
The USer Entity has User fields like Name ,id etc and a Rating Field.
So for this Particular RAting Field will Create Another RAting Service and Call the Rating Service when ever we will need any RAting details about the User.
This is the Implementation of MicroService.
